# WiDS-dataset_ML
This project is for Phase two of the WiDS dataset, which includes ML for prediction.

Deliverables:
- Data Preprocessing Pipeline (pandas and sklearn)
- Feature Transformation Pipeline (sklearn and feature-engine)
- Model Training Pipeline (sklearn, xgboost, lgbm, catboost)
- Model Evaluation Pipeline (sklearn)
- HParam Search Pipeline (optuna)
- Export the final trained model and write the code for inference via the CLI
